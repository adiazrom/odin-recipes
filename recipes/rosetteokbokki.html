        <p>Do you like tteokbeokki? If so, have you tried rose tteokbeokki? Tteokbokki is the #1 Korean street food and it is so popular all around the world now. Recently, tteokbeokki has been very popular and trendy in Korea. The original rose sauce is made from tomato sauce and cream creating a beautiful rose color. The idea is the same for rose tteokbeokki, but instead of tomato sauce, we use gochujang based spicy sauce. So delicious! It's creamy, spicy, and savory, so satisfying!</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Cook the glass noodles in boiling water by following the package instructions. Usually, it takes about 8 to 10 minutes, so meanwhile, let's start making the rose sauce.</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium, add the cooking oil and swirl to coat. Add the sliced onion and garlic, season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Sauté for 2 to 3 minutes or until onion is transparent.</li>
            <li>Add gochujang, soy sauce, gochugaru, and sauté everything together for a minute. The sauces are most likely stuck to the bottom of the pan which is totally fine, that's where the flavor's at!</li>
            <li>Now, before the sauces are burning, go ahead and pour plant-based milk and deglaze the bottom with a wooden spoon. Season the sauce with mushroom seasoning, agave nectar, and nutritional yeast.</li>
            <li>Bring the sauce back to simmer and by this time, the glass noodles should be ready to go too, so go ahead and drain the noodles and add them into the sauce along with the prepared rice cake. Stir well and bring back to a simmer.</li>
            <li>Stir in the yubu and green onion and remove from the heat. Serve immediately and enjoy!</li>
